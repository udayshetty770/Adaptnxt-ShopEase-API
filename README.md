#  Adaptnxt ShopEase API - E-Commerce Backend with JWT & Role-Based Access

A Java-based e-commerce backend developed for the Backend Developer Internship assignment at Adaptnxt. This REST-style API supports user authentication, role-based access, product listing, cart management, and order creation using Servlets, MySQL, and JWT.

##  Features Implemented

###  Core Functionalities

- **User Authentication (JWT-based)**
  - Secure login and token generation
  - Role identification (`admin` or `customer`)

- **Role-based Access**
  - `Customer`: View products, manage cart, and place orders
  - `Admin`: Full product management (add, update, delete)

- **Product Listing**
  - All users can view available products
  - (Admin can manage products via secure endpoints)

- **Cart Management**
  - Add items to cart
  - Update or remove items
  - View cart items

- **Order Creation**
  - Convert cart to order (only for customers)

- **Basic Frontend**
  - JSP-based pages (optional, minimal UI)

##  JWT Usage

- JWT is sent in `Authorization` header:  
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>

- Backend validates token and parses user claims (email, role).

---

##  How to Test

You can use **Postman** to test the endpoints:

1. Register or Login → get JWT token  
2. Pass token in header to access secured routes  
3. Perform role-specific actions (admin/customer)

---

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Import as Maven Project into IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ)
3. Configure MySQL DB (`DBConnection.java`)
4. Run on Apache Tomcat 9
5. Access via browser or Postman
